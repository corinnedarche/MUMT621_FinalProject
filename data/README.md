# Note On Data Format

Due to GitHub's file upload limitations, each dataset is split into multiple zipped folders.

The rapping data was taken from [AudioSet](https://research.google.com/audioset/dataset/rapping.html) and downloaded using code from [Aoife McDonagh](https://github.com/aoifemcdonagh/audioset-processing). The Gregorian chant dataset was created from videos taken from Vo Duc Quang's YouTube playlist ["Gregorian Chants"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3930DBA3929A5221).
